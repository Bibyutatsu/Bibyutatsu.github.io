                <h3>PwC</h3>
                <h4>Manager (AI/ML)</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Cloud-Native Multi-Agent ETL Platform</b></li>
                      <p>Designed and led a scalable ETL system on Azure.

By distributing work across parallel agents and optimizing schema-driven execution, it reduced data ingestion time from ~10 hours to about 15 minutes (≈40× speedup). The cleaned data is stored in a database, enabling downstream real-time analytics and access via chat-based interfaces.</p>
                      <li><b>Financial Filings Query System</b></li>
                      <p>Implemented a multi-agent document analysis system for financial reports (10-K/10-Q). Deployed a pipeline that parses, indexes, and semantically understands thousands of audit filings. Analysts can pose queries in natural language and quickly rank companies on 17 key financial metrics. This reduced decision-making time from days to just a few hours, greatly accelerating competitive analysis and investment research.</p>
                      <li><b>Text-to-SQL Integration Engine</b></li>
                      <p>Built a unified interface for querying data across heterogeneous sources. The solution uses a multi-agent workflow to convert natural language text (questions or prompts) into SQL queries that combine structured databases and unstructured text corpora. By automating this Text-to-SQL translation, the system enables non-technical users to extract insights from diverse data without manual query writing. This improved data accessibility and boosted analyst productivity by over 30%.</p>
                      <li><b>Contextual Recommendation Engine</b></li>
                      <p>Developed a personalization system for ecommerce that fuses behavioral knowledge graphs with LLM-based reasoning.

                      <p>Architected a production pipeline to auto-respond to user policy queries by email. Implemented backend orchestration that classifies incoming questions, retrieves relevant policy snippets, and composes replies with accurate citations. This system reduced manual handling time by ~15% while improving response consistency and user satisfaction.</p>
                      <li><b>Document Q&A System on Big Corpora</b></li>
                      <p>Designed a scalable question-answering platform over large PDF datasets. Leveraged Azure Cognitive Search with OpenAI/LLM chains to index and retrieve answers from millions of pages. The pipeline allows users to query complex documents (e.g. contracts, reports) in natural language and receive concise, sourced answers, greatly speeding up information retrieval for analysts.</p>
                      <li><b>English Proficiency (CEFR) Scorer from Audio</b></li>
                      <p>Created an automated system to score English speech on the CEFR scale. Audio inputs are first transcribed using OpenAI Whisper; then acoustic and linguistic features (lexical, syntactic, prosodic) are extracted and fed to a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 classifier. In testing, the model achieved ~94% accuracy in classifying proficiency levels, enabling rapid, reliable language assessment.</p>
                      <li><b>Multimodal Inference Demonstration App</b></li>

                      <li><b>Active-Learning NLP Annotation System</b></li>
                      <p>Led development of an NLP pipeline with active learning. Integrated Label Studio to annotate a small initial dataset, iteratively retrained models (combining deep learning and rule-based components) on the most informative samples. This reduced manual labeling by focusing effort where the model was uncertain, thereby accelerating model training and improving performance with minimal data.</p>
                      <li><b>Delivery Route Optimization (Quantum Annealing)</b></li>
                      <p>Applied quantum optimization to logistics. Formulated the routing and fleet-allocation problem for a delivery service and solved it using quantum annealing (D-Wave Leap). This approach yielded ~35% reduction in simulated routing cost and a ~20% increase in on-time delivery rate in trials.

                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Novel Molecule Generation for Drug Discovery</b></li>
                      <p>Developed generative AI to create new chemical compounds targeting a given protein. Employed a multi-stage architecture combining Variational Autoencoders (VAE, Junction-Tree VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks, with Reinforcement Learning rewards shaped by Self-Organizing Maps to bias sampling in desirable chemical space. Custom tokenizers for SMILES strings and comprehensive benchmarking (ZINC dataset, MOSES) were implemented. This innovative pipeline was awarded a $1 M Hessen grant and covered by media (e.g. Wall Street Journal, Forbes) for generating novel molecules with high bioactivity.</p>
                      <li><b>Disease-Gene Prediction with Explainable AI</b></li>
                      <p>Designed an explainable ML model to identify disease-causing genes. Trained predictive models on genomic data and applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to rank genes by influence. The system achieved ~85% mean average precision in top‑5 gene predictions, providing interpretable insights into genetic causes of disease.</p>
                      <li><b>Automated Drug-Design Pipeline</b></li>
                      <p>Implemented an end-to-end workflow for drug discovery, integrating molecule filtering, protein–ligand docking, and scoring. This pipeline automatically processes candidate compounds (e.g. docking to target proteins) and ranks them by predicted efficacy. The result was a streamlined screening process that accelerated discovery by reducing manual steps, improving efficiency in identifying promising drug candidates.</p>
                      <li><b>Sales Demand Forecasting (LSTM-Based)</b></li>
                      <p>Built a time-series forecasting system to predict product demand. Developed LSTM neural networks on historical sales data, yielding high accuracy (RMSE ≈ 2.5%) in forecasting future demand. The model supported data-driven planning, enabling better inventory and supply-chain decisions.</p>
                      <li><b>Document Data Extraction (PDFs & Tables)</b></li>
                      <p>Created automated pipelines to parse and extract data from documents. For PDFs, the system segments paragraphs (using rule-based image processing) and applies Tesseract OCR to convert scanned or digital PDFs into structured content. For tables, a combination of rule-based methods and a Faster R-CNN model detects and isolates tables; a custom "Table-Maker" then normalizes any table format into standard CSV and uses Tesseract to extract text. These tools together enabled reliable conversion of complex documents into machine-readable datasets.</p>
                      <li><b>Hierarchical Disease Classification</b></li>
                      <p>Developed a two-stage classifier for medical documents. First, fine-tuned BERT models classify text into disease categories. Then, a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) refines predictions based on disease ontology. This hierarchical pipeline organizes diseases into a taxonomy, improving classification accuracy for complex, multi-label data.</p>
                      <li><b>ML Deployment Infrastructure (TorchServe & MLflow)</b></li>
                      <p>Established a scalable model-serving and version-control framework. Packaged deep-learning models with TorchServe and tracked experiments in MLflow, automating deployment to production. This infrastructure enabled continuous integration and versioning of ML models, significantly reducing manual overhead in operations.</p>

                        <p>
                            This paper finds the solution for simultaneous arrival of a swarm of fixed-wing UAVs in a three-dimensional (3D) environment filled with obstacles. For generating obstacle free waypoint segments in the cluttered environment 3D Voronoi diagram is used and then to select the k-best paths Yen’s algorithm is adopted. Finally, to make the path flyable and of equal length for all the fixedwing UAVs, an innovative approach is presented here for simultaneous rendezvous. Simulation results are presented here to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms and finally the presence of dynamic obstacles are also considered to enhance the applicability of the algorithm in real-life scenarios.
