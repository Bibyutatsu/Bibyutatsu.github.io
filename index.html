                        <h5>Cloud-Native Multi-Agent ETL Platform</h5>
                        <p>Designed and led a scalable ETL system on Azure. The platform reads user-supplied Excel files
                            and “control” specification sheets, then autonomously generates Python-based data
                            transformation pipelines. By distributing work across parallel agents and optimizing
                            schema-driven execution, it reduced data ingestion time from ~10 hours to about 15 minutes
                            (≈40× speedup). The cleaned data is stored in a database, enabling downstream real-time
                            analytics and access via chat-based interfaces.</p>

                        <h5>Financial Filings Query System</h5>
                        <p>Implemented a multi-agent document analysis system for financial reports (10-K/10-Q).
                            Deployed a pipeline that parses, indexes, and semantically understands thousands of audit
                            filings. Analysts can pose queries in natural language and quickly rank companies on 17 key
                            financial metrics. This reduced decision-making time from days to just a few hours, greatly
                            accelerating competitive analysis and investment research.</p>

                        <h5>Text-to-SQL Integration Engine</h5>
                        <p>Built a unified interface for querying data across heterogeneous sources. The solution uses a
                            multi-agent workflow to convert natural language text (questions or prompts) into SQL
                            queries that combine structured databases and unstructured text corpora. By automating this
                            Text-to-SQL translation, the system enables non-technical users to extract insights from
                            diverse data without manual query writing. This improved data accessibility and boosted
                            analyst productivity by over 30%.</p>

                            LLM-based reasoning. The pipeline models user journeys and product relations to suggest
                            context-aware items and campaigns. By reasoning over this graph-structured data with large
                            language models, the system delivers highly relevant recommendations that adapt to each
                            customer’s history and context.</p>

                        <p>Created an automated system to score English speech on the CEFR scale. Audio inputs are first
                            transcribed using OpenAI Whisper; then acoustic and linguistic features (lexical, syntactic,
                            prosodic) are extracted and fed to a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 classifier. In testing, the model
                            achieved ~94% accuracy in classifying proficiency levels, enabling rapid, reliable language
                            assessment.</p>

                            engine finds the top-3 images from a large gallery matching a text or image query, then
                            generates descriptive captions for the input image. This tool supports intuitive image
                            browsing and annotation, useful for media and marketing teams to quickly find and describe

                            a small initial dataset, iteratively retrained models (combining deep learning and
                            rule-based components) on the most informative samples. This reduced manual labeling by
                            focusing effort where the model was uncertain, thereby accelerating model training and

                            problem for a delivery service and solved it using quantum annealing (D-Wave Leap). This
                            approach yielded ~35% reduction in simulated routing cost and a ~20% increase in on-time
                            delivery rate in trials. The solution dynamically computed optimal number of agents and

                            a multi-stage architecture combining Variational Autoencoders (VAE, Junction-Tree VAE) and
                            Generative Adversarial Networks, with Reinforcement Learning rewards shaped by
                            Self-Organizing Maps to bias sampling in desirable chemical space. Custom tokenizers for
                            SMILES strings and comprehensive benchmarking (ZINC dataset, MOSES) were implemented. This
                            innovative pipeline was awarded a $1 M Hessen grant and covered by media (e.g. Wall Street
                            Journal, Forbes) for generating novel molecules with high bioactivity.</p>

                        <h5>Disease-Gene Prediction with Explainable AI</h5>
                        <p>Designed an explainable ML model to identify disease-causing genes. Trained predictive models
                            on genomic data and applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to rank genes by influence.
                            The system achieved ~85% mean average precision in top‑5 gene predictions, providing
                            interpretable insights into genetic causes of disease.</p>

                        <h5>Automated Drug-Design Pipeline</h5>
                        <p>Implemented an end-to-end workflow for drug discovery, integrating molecule filtering,
                            protein–ligand docking, and scoring. This pipeline automatically processes candidate
                            compounds (e.g. docking to target proteins) and ranks them by predicted efficacy. The result
                            was a streamlined screening process that accelerated discovery by reducing manual steps,
                            improving efficiency in identifying promising drug candidates.</p>

                        <h5>Sales Demand Forecasting (LSTM-Based)</h5>
                        <p>Built a time-series forecasting system to predict product demand. Developed LSTM neural
                            networks on historical sales data, yielding high accuracy (RMSE ≈ 2.5%) in forecasting
                            future demand. The model supported data-driven planning, enabling better inventory and

                        <h5>Document Data Extraction (PDFs & Tables)</h5>
                        <p>Created automated pipelines to parse and extract data from documents. For PDFs, the system
                            segments paragraphs (using rule-based image processing) and applies Tesseract OCR to convert
                            scanned or digital PDFs into structured content. For tables, a combination of rule-based
                            methods and a Faster R-CNN model detects and isolates tables; a custom “Table-Maker” then
                            normalizes any table format into standard CSV and uses Tesseract to extract text. These
                            tools together enabled reliable conversion of complex documents into machine-readable
                            datasets.</p>

                            classify text into disease categories. Then, a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) refines
                            predictions based on disease ontology. This hierarchical pipeline organizes diseases into a
                            taxonomy, improving classification accuracy for complex, multi-label data.</p>

                            models with TorchServe and tracked experiments in MLflow, automating deployment to
                            production. This infrastructure enabled continuous integration and versioning of ML models,

                            wrappers) to convert each region into text. Simultaneously, a deep-learning table-detection
                            model identified tables and converted them into CSV format. These pipelines enabled
                            automated conversion of document images to structured data, and contributions were made
